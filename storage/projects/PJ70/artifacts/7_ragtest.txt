Ravi and Nimal were sitting in the campus lab discussing the progress of their final-year software project, a web platform that connects overseas job seekers with verified recruitment agencies. Ravi explained that during the first month they finished the system design and database schema, then set up the Spring Boot backend with PostgreSQL and implemented user authentication using AWS Cognito. Nimal added that they had already completed the core features like agency registration, job postings, and a rating system, and recently integrated an AI-powered resume analyzer using Ollama for smarter matching. However, they ran into issues with server ports conflicting with Jenkins and spent a day fixing deployment inside WSL. Now the backend APIs are stable, the frontend dashboard is halfway done in React, and their next goal is testing and deployment before the submission deadline.
