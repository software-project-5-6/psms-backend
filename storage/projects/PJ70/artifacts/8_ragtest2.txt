After their weekly progress meeting, Anjana and Kavish stayed back in the lab to review how far their recruitment platform had come since the beginning of the semester. They recalled that the project started with requirement gathering sessions where they interviewed several overseas job seekers and local agencies to understand common problems like fake listings and poor communication. Based on that, they designed a microservice-style architecture with a Spring Boot backend, PostgreSQL database with pgvector for embeddings, and a React frontend. During the first sprint, they implemented authentication and authorization using AWS Cognito and JWT tokens, then built modules for agency registration, job postings, document uploads, and user reviews. In the second sprint, they focused on adding an AI-powered matching system: they chunked resumes into tokens, generated embeddings using the nomic-embed-text model, stored them in the vector database, and used the llama3.2 model through Ollama to answer semantic search queries in a RAG pipeline. Although the features worked, deployment wasn’t smooth—Jenkins accidentally occupied port 8080 inside WSL, breaking their backend until they stopped the service and changed configurations. After fixing that, they containerized the application with Docker, set up automated tests, and configured CI/CD so every Git push triggered a build and integration tests. Now most core functionalities are complete, performance has improved after query optimization and caching, and they are preparing for user acceptance testing while documenting the system for their final presentation.
